   array and transfer he array into text format and itnerate though on the other end
2) when creating the balls add them all to a central object array where you can easly look at each 
   one and actualy destoy them
3) for the ending check when the 8-ball get hit in and then check to see if all the players balls 
   have been destoryed if not they lose
